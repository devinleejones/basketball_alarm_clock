Interactive Basketball Alarm Clock

Components- M5Stack ESP32 Core Ink, Adafruit NeoPixel LED Strip (30), IR Sensor

How it works- The Microcontroller has an alarm that triggers the LED strip to blink red. Once a user shoots a basket and makes it, the IR Sensor will read the data and trigger the alarm to stop and the LED strip will blink white.

Input - IR Sensor
Output - NeoPixel Led Strip
